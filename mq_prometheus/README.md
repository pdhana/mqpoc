# MQ Exporter for Prometheus monitoring

This directory contains the code for a monitoring solution
that exports queue manager data to a Prometheus data collection
system. It also contains configuration files to run the monitor program

The monitor collects metrics published by an MQ V9 queue manager
or the MQ appliance. Prometheus than calls the monitor program
at regular intervals to pull those metrics into its database, where
they can then be queried directly or used by other packages
such as Grafana.

You can see data such as disk or CPU usage, queue depths, and MQI call
counts. Channel status is also reported.

Example Grafana dashboards are included, to show how queries might
be constructed. To use the dashboard,
create a data source in Grafana called "MQ Prometheus" that points at your
database server, and then import the JSON file. This dashboard was
built using Grafana v5.3.1

There is also a script to start the collector so that it processes
the statistics generated by the MQ Bridge for Salesforce, included from
MQ V9.0.2

## Configuring MQ
It is convenient to run the monitor program as a queue manager service whenever
possible.

This directory contains an MQSC script to define the service. In fact, the
service definition points at a simple script which sets up any
necessary environment and builds the command line parameters for the
real monitor program. As the last line of the script is "exec", the
process id of the script is inherited by the monitor program, and the
queue manager can then check on the status, and can drive a suitable
`STOP SERVICE` operation during queue manager shutdown.

Edit the MQSC script and the shell script to point at appropriate directories
where the program exists, and where you want to put stdout/stderr.
Ensure that the ID running the queue manager has permission to access
the programs and output files.

If you cannot run the monitor as a service, for example when
trying to monitor the MQ Appliance which does not support
service definitions, or monitoring another platform without Go support,
then you can run as
an MQ client connecting remotely. Setting the `ibmmq.client` property
to `true` forces client connections. Then all the usual MQ configuration
comes into play (MQSERVER environment variable, use of CCDT files etc).

The monitor listens for calls from Prometheus on a TCP port. The default
port, reserved for MQ's use in the Prometheus list, is 9157. If you
want to use a different number, then use the `-ibmmq.httpListenPort`
command parameter.

## Configuring Prometheus
The Prometheus server has to know how to contact the MQ monitor. The
simplest way is just to add a reference to the monitor in the
server's configuration file. For example, by adding this block
to /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml.

```
  # Adding a reference to an MQ monitor. All we have to do is
  # name the host and port on which the monitor is listening.
  # Port 9157 is the reserved default port for this monitor.
  - job_name: 'ibmmq'
          scrape_interval: 15s

    static_configs:
          - targets: ['hostname.example.com:9157']
```

The server documentation has information on more complex
options, including the ability to pull information on which hosts
should be monitored from a variety of discovery tools.

## Metrics
Once the monitor program has been started, and Prometheus refreshed to
connect to it, you will see metrics being available in the prometheus
console. All of the metrics are given the a prefix which by
default is **ibmmq**. The name can be configured with the `-namespace` option
on the command line.

More information on the metrics collected through the publish/subscribe
interface can be found in the [MQ KnowledgeCenter](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.mon.doc/mo00013_.htm)
with further description in [an MQDev blog entry](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/messaging/entry/Statistics_published_to_the_system_topic_in_MQ_v9?lang=en)

The queue and queue manager metrics shown in the Prometheus console are named after the descriptions
that you can see when running the amqsrua sample program, but with some
minor modifications to match the required style.

The channel metrics all begin with `channel`.
